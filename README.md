#### Docker

```sh
docker run --name docuseal -p 3000:3000 -v.:/data docuseal/docuseal
```

By default DocuSeal docker container uses an SQLite database to store data and configurations. Alternatively, it is possible to use PostgreSQL or MySQL databases by specifying the `DATABASE_URL` env variable.

#### Docker Compose

Download docker-compose.yml into your private server:
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docusealco/docuseal/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
```

Run the app under a custom domain over https using docker compose (make sure your DNS points to the server to automatically issue ssl certs with Caddy):
```sh
sudo HOST=your-domain-name.com docker compose up
```
